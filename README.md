# bash-waypoints
Augment bash scripts with REPL waypoints -- a simple "(n)ext, r(e)do, (a)bort, (r)un" and readline editor for bash scripts .

 - Clone this repo
 - **cd** to the locally cloned directory
 - Run the example bash script "**example.sh**"
 - Script will automatically pause at each declared "waypoint" in example.sh and allow you to  
 edit the line directly on the command line **OR** type Cntrl-C and proceed as directed from that menu
 
 ### Hack to your particular environment and purposes (demos are one great purpose)...
