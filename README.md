# bash-waypoints
Augment bash scripts with REPL (Read-Eval-Print-Loop) waypoints -- a simple "(**n**)ext, r(**e**)do, (**a**)bort, (**r**)un" and **readline**-style editor for bash scripts .

 - Clone this repo
 - **cd** to the locally cloned directory
 - Run the example bash script "**example.sh**"
 - Script will automatically pause at each declared "waypoint" in example.sh and allow you to  
 edit the line directly on the CLI **OR** type **Ctrl-C** and proceed as directed from that menu
 
 ### Hack for your particular environment and purposes (giving semi-interactive demos are one great purpose)...
